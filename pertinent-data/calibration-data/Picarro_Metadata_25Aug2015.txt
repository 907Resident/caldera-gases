Objective: Use the zero air gas to analyze the quantity and isotopic composition of its gases, primarily
carbon dioxide.  We sought to find out if the zero air would be a viable source as a secondary calibration gas.

Started measuring at 11:30 
>>Measured the laboratory air until 12:02
Switched to measuring the zero air from 12:03 until 12:09
>>Lost pressure and had to reconfigure line
>>>>Restarted measuring zero air at 12:10
>>Lost pressure again around 12:20/12:23
>>>>Restarted measuring zero air at 12:25

Looking at the real-time measurements, it appears that the CO2 concentrations are too small to make the
zero air a viable candidate for a secondary calibration gas.
