Picarro Metadata

User: Ajayi, Moyo
Location : Stevenson 5712, Nashville, TN
General Conditions: Indoor Laboratory

Objective: Use the standard methane gas (Tiso-3, Isometric Instruments) to gauge the precision of the picarro
at a first order.  

Comments: The instrument was run using laboratory conditions from roughly 14:00 until 14:35.  At 14:35,
the first attempt to measure the standard was made.  However, in high-precision mode (HP) the picarro issued an
alarm.  After examining the measurements in high-range (HR) it was determined that HR should be used to measure
the standard.  At roughly 15:02, continuous measuring of the Tiso-3 standard was made until 15:18. Following
the measurement of the standard, the Picarro returned to measuring the laboratory air until roughly 15:30.
